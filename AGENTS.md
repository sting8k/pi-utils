<!-- HARNESS:BEGIN -->
## Harness

Default flow: understand the request and relevant design, implement the smallest fitting change, verify it, then reconcile affected documentation, durable decisions, and required evidence before reporting. Clauses that do not apply create no artifact.

Start with `docs/HARNESS.md`. Retrieve other Harness docs only when its triggers or the task require them; do not load the full framework by default.

Use the Rust Harness CLI at `scripts/bin/harness-cli` on macOS/Linux or `scripts/bin/harness-cli.exe` on Windows when the completion contract or task coordination requires durable records or mechanical checks.
