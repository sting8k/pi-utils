# just-harness

Turn any software repo into an agent-ready workspace.

`just-harness` is a repository-level operating harness for Claude Code,
Codex, Cursor, and other coding agents. It gives agents the missing project
context they need before they change code: where to start, what the product
contract says, how risky the work is, what proof is required, and which
decisions future agents should inherit.

The app is what users touch. The harness is what agents touch.

## Why Star This Repo

Star this repo if you want practical, reusable patterns for making AI-assisted
software development more reliable, inspectable, and easier for humans to steer.

This project is exploring a simple idea:

> Coding agents do not only need better prompts. They need better repositories.

## The Problem

Most repos are built for humans reading code in a familiar codebase. Coding
agents usually enter with only a chat prompt and a shallow snapshot of files.
That leads to common failure modes:

- The agent edits code before understanding product intent.
- Important constraints live only in chat history or in someone's head.
- Validation expectations are vague or discovered too late.
- Architecture tradeoffs are repeated instead of inherited.
- Large requests do not get broken into reviewable packet-sized work.

## The Harness Approach

A repository starts to have a harness when it helps an agent answer practical
engineering questions without relying only on chat history:

- What should I read first?
- What type of work is this?
- Which work or product contract does it affect?
- How risky is the change?
- What proof will show the work is done?
- What decision or lesson should future agents inherit?

In this repo, those answers live in:

- `AGENTS.md` — the stable agent shim with local project notes and Harness doc links.
- `docs/HARNESS.md` — the human-agent collaboration model.
- `docs/FEATURE_INTAKE.md` — intake and warmup for tiny, normal, and high-risk work.
- `docs/CONTEXT_RULES.md` — what to read and when.
- `docs/GUARDRAILS.md` — durable project directives.
- `docs/ARTIFACTS.md` — naming and folder taxonomy.
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — architecture discovery and boundary rules.
- `docs/TEST_MATRIX.md` — behavior-to-proof validation expectations.
- `docs/stories/` — work packets and backlog.
- `docs/decisions/` — durable decisions and tradeoffs.
- `docs/templates/` — reusable packet, decision, and validation templates.

OpenAI describes this shift as an agent-first world where humans steer and
agents execute:

## Install Harness Into A Project

From a target project directory, run:

```bash
curl -fsSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sting8k/just-harness/main/scripts/install-harness.sh?$(date +%s)" | bash -s -- --yes
```

On Windows PowerShell, run:

```powershell
& ([scriptblock]::Create((irm "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sting8k/just-harness/main/scripts/install-harness.ps1"))) -Yes
```

If the target already has `AGENTS.md`, `docs/`, or `scripts/`, choose one:

```bash
# Update an existing Harness repo without moving existing files
curl -fsSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sting8k/just-harness/main/scripts/install-harness.sh?$(date +%s)" | bash -s -- --merge --yes

# Back up and replace AGENTS.md, docs/, and scripts/
curl -fsSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sting8k/just-harness/main/scripts/install-harness.sh?$(date +%s)" | bash -s -- --override --yes
```

```powershell
# Update an existing Harness repo without moving existing files
& ([scriptblock]::Create((irm "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sting8k/just-harness/main/scripts/install-harness.ps1"))) -Merge -Yes

# Back up and replace AGENTS.md, docs/, and scripts/
& ([scriptblock]::Create((irm "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sting8k/just-harness/main/scripts/install-harness.ps1"))) -Override -Yes
```

Use `--merge` when a project already has Harness and you want to append newly
added Harness files without moving the existing `AGENTS.md`, `docs/`, or
`scripts/` paths into backup. Existing files stay untouched; only missing
Harness files are created.

For older Harness installs whose `AGENTS.md` still contains the full generated
operating guide, refresh it into the small stable shim:

```bash
curl -fsSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sting8k/just-harness/main/scripts/install-harness.sh?$(date +%s)" | bash -s -- --merge --refresh-agent-shim --yes
```

The refresh backs up the existing file. If it detects the old
Harness-generated guide, it replaces it with the shim. If the file appears
custom, it appends or updates a marked Harness block instead of overwriting the
project's local instructions.

If the project is driven with Claude Code, add `--claude`. Claude Code never
auto-loads `AGENTS.md`, so without this the installed harness is invisible to
fresh sessions. The flag installs (or refreshes) a `CLAUDE.md` whose marked
Harness block imports only the small `AGENTS.md` entrypoint. Other Harness docs
are retrieved when the task requires them. An existing `CLAUDE.md` gets the
block appended after a backup; plain installs without the flag never touch
`CLAUDE.md`:

```bash
curl -fsSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sting8k/just-harness/main/scripts/install-harness.sh?$(date +%s)" | bash -s -- --claude --yes
```

Or install into a specific path:

```bash
curl -fsSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sting8k/just-harness/main/scripts/install-harness.sh?$(date +%s)" | bash -s -- --directory /path/to/project --yes
```

```powershell
& ([scriptblock]::Create((irm "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sting8k/just-harness/main/scripts/install-harness.ps1"))) -Directory C:\path\to\project -Yes
```

Use `--dry-run` on Bash or `-DryRun` on PowerShell to preview changes before
writing files.

The installer also downloads the prebuilt Harness CLI for the current platform,
verifies its `.sha256` checksum, and installs it at
`scripts/bin/harness-cli` on macOS/Linux or `scripts/bin/harness-cli.exe` on
Windows. The Rust CLI is the main Harness tool and stable command path.

Harness CLI release assets are published from tags by the
`Harness CLI Release` GitHub Actions workflow. The installer expects each
release to include `harness-cli-<platform>` and
`harness-cli-<platform>.sha256` assets for macOS arm64, macOS x64, Linux x64,
Linux arm64, and Windows x64. The Windows asset is
`harness-cli-windows-x64.exe` plus `harness-cli-windows-x64.exe.sha256`.

## Try The Flow

The fastest way to understand the harness is to inspect the demo:

- `docs/demo/README.md`: shows how a simple product idea becomes intake output, a flat work packet, proof expectations, and durable learning before implementation starts.

The default flow is deliberately small:

```text
understand -> implement -> verify -> report
```

Intake, work packets, traces, and decisions are available when risk, durable
tracking, handoff, or consequential choices make them useful. They are not
mandatory stages for routine work.

## Current State

This repository is in Harness v0.

There is no application implementation and no baked-in product specification yet. The current work is the reusable project harness: the file structure, agent operating model, intake process, guardrails, work packet templates, and validation expectations that help humans and agents turn a future user-provided spec into implementation work.

## Product Sources

No product contract is currently defined.

When a user provides a project specification, add or reference it as the input spec for the first buildout, then derive smaller living artifacts from it:

- `docs/product/`: current work contract files.
- `docs/stories/`: work packets and backlog.
- `docs/decisions/`: durable decisions and tradeoffs.
- `docs/GUARDRAILS.md`: durable project directives.
- `docs/ARTIFACTS.md`: naming and folder rules.
- `docs/TEST_MATRIX.md`: behavior-to-proof control panel.

Do not keep a project-specific spec or product breakdown in this harness until a real project supplies one.

## Contributing

This project is early and benefits most from real-world agent failure cases,
example harness installs, docs improvements, and reusable workflow patterns.
See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for contribution ideas.

Useful contributions include:

- Show how the harness works in a real project.
- Add missing templates or improve existing ones.
- Propose validation patterns for different stacks.
- Share failures where an agent made the wrong change because the repo lacked
  context.
- Compare harness behavior across Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, and other tools.

## Share

If this idea resonates, please star the repo and share it with someone building
with coding agents.
